// The OVMS_CAN_WRITE switch controls the CAN mode of the OVMS system
// Leaving it undefined (the default) will put the CAN bus in LISTEN mode. It
// will not be written to and no acnkowledgements will be issued on the bus.
// Defining it will put the CAN bus in NORMAL mode. This will allow the
// system to co-operate with the CAN bus (eg; issuing acknowledgements) and
// also give it the ability to transmit messages on the CAN bus.
// Not defining OVMS_CAN_WRITE is obviously less likely to interfere with
// the vehicle normal operations.
//#define OVMS_CAN_WRITE

// The OVMS_CAR_2010 switch should be defined if the vehicle is a 2010 (or
// later) roadster.
#define OVMS_CAR_2010

// Prevents the OVMS net_sms module from sending "access denied" SMS
// (for some operators/plans, SMS are charged on per use basis)
//#define OVMS_SUPPRESS_ACCESSDENIED_SMS

// Prevents the OVMS net_sms module from sending all SMS messages
// (useful for data-only plans with expensive SMS rates)
//#define OVMS_SUPPRESS_OUTGOING_SMS
